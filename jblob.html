<h1>jBlob</h1>
<p>jBlob is sort of the almalgamation of all my works... it's a concept/thing/idea/world (not exactly sure), that's present through most of my works</p>
<p>For example, the blob like characters on the top 3 nav bar items are, well, blobs. </p>

<a href="https://replit.com/@nullEntity/jBlob?v=1"> You can play the first jBlob game here!</a>
<p>The first jBlob game is a clicker game, and also my first every foray into coding, ever. As such, the game is buggy, unfinished in places, but good fun. There is no real end goal other than maybe collect every blob in the game. </p>
<p>The game mostly focuses on amassing coins and resources to explore features of the jblob 'world', contained in a small point and click HTML CSS JS webpage.</p>
</body>

<p>There are multiple other projects I've developed that are part of the jBlob universe (canonically I suppose), but are unfinished as games. However, the groundwork and skeleton is present, they simply need fleshing out</p>

<a href="https://github.com/jblob-devs/blobby"> jBlob blobby</a> is an idle rpg style game</p>

<a href="https://github.com/jblob-devs/blobby">Play here!</a>

<p><i>The following jbloblets dont have a playable prototype currently up and running</i></p>
<a href="https://github.com/jblob-devs/jblob"> jBlob 1.5</a> is a rehash, with exploration into managing a backend and a 'collection' system</p>

<a href="https://github.com/nullentityexe/jblobverI"> jBlob ver I</a> attempts to build a mobile version of a game</p>

<a href="https://github.com/nullentityexe/jblob"> jBlob Dungeon (unoffically codenamed)</a> was supposed to be a roguelike, but for now its a nice html skill display</p>

<p>The art, assets, music, style, story and ideas for the jblob concept have all been uniquely me!</p>
<p>Most of the gamelets are solely coded by me, but a few have valuable assistance from others!</p>
