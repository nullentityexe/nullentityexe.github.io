# Blog Testing

Markdown is a really easy to use way to create blogs.
Since there is essentially no coding expierience needed it's often prefered by many.

You can **bold** words or *italize* them pretty easily. In the editor, the **bolded** and *italized* words show up as **bolded** or *italized*, so it's clear and easy to see how your page would look like on the website itself.

> Blockquotes
>
> Blockquotes function as nested text. Perfect for, as the name implies, quotes.
