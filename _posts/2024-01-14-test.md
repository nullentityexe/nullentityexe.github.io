Markdown is a really easy to use way to create blogs.
Since there is essentially no coding expierience needed it's often prefered by many.

You can **bold** words or *italize* them pretty easily. In the editor, the **bolded** and *italized* words show up as **bolded** or *italized*, so it's clear and easy to see how your page would look like on the website itself.

~~You can also strike through words or sentences.~~

Why even use Markdown when trusty old HTML can get the job down?

Well, Markdown is much simpler to write an use. Its as easy as typing your thoughts down. No need to use *<p>* or *<h1>* tags at all. 

However, this doesn't mean you have to choose either or. Markdown works seemlessly with HTML, meaning all you have to do is type html as you would normally into your .md (markdown) file.
