Eclipses are pretty cool. The concept of an exponentially smaller object blocking out an exponentially bigger object in space always is a sight to behold.

Eclipses are also pretty prominent in modern literature, and history. There's lots of myths on Eclipses actually the sun being swallowed by some beast, or something around those lines.

I've always thought ellipses were just plain cool, but never read too much science on it. 

Be careful though, you still can't look directly at an eclipse without proper protection.

P.S. I just realized I've been spelling "eclipse" wrong this whole time. Better fix that.
